erlp
=====

An Erlang library to decode Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoded data and encode properly formated Erlang terms to RLP.
RLP is used in Ethereum project to only encode data structure. Data type encoding is left to higher order protocols.
It works for me. It has some helpers included. I have no plans of maintaining this code.
